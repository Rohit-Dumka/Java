A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java :
1>Abstract class (0 to 100%)
2>Interface (100%)

A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.
ex: abstract void show();

Notes:
If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
